Interview with Boots
The `calculate_damage` function is called 3 times in the example. Which variables store the results?

Boots is expecting you to satisfy the acceptance criteria:
1. The first call to `calculate_damage` stores the result in `first_damage`.
2. The second call to `calculate_damage` stores the result in `second_damage`.
3. The third call to `calculate_damage` stores the result in `third_damage`.
